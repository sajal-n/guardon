This project follows the Contributor Covenant to foster an open and welcoming community. By participating you agree to respect other contributors and maintain a harassment-free environment.

Key points:

- Be respectful and constructive in discussions and reviews.
- Address others' ideas, not the person.
- Report abusive behavior or security problems privately to the maintainers (see SECURITY.md).
