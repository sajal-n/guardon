# Governance

This document describes the minimal governance model for the Guardon project. It is intentionally small for the sandbox stage and can be expanded as the community grows.

## Mission

Guardon helps developers and reviewers detect common Kubernetes misconfigurations and suggest safe fixes directly from the browser on code-hosting platforms.

## Decision model

- Day-to-day maintenance and release decisions are made by the maintainers listed in `MAINTAINERS.md`.
- For non-trivial changes (major API changes, license changes, or project direction), maintainers should seek consensus among active contributors via issues or a short design proposal.
- If maintainers cannot reach consensus, the maintainers group will vote; a majority wins. If the group is unavailable, the original project owner(s) may make an interim decision.

## How to become a maintainer

- Contributions are welcome. To be considered for maintainer status a contributor should:
  1. Submit multiple, high-quality PRs and participate in reviews.
 2. Demonstrate sustained interest in the project and familiarity with its codebase.
 3. Be nominated by an existing maintainer and approved by consensus.

## Releases

- Releases follow the `RELEASE.md` checklist. Maintainers are responsible for tagging releases and updating the changelog.

## Security and responsible disclosure

- See `SECURITY.md` for contact and disclosure process.

## Community resources

- Code of Conduct: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- Contribution guidelines: `CONTRIBUTING.md`

If you have questions about governance, open an issue tagged `governance` or reach out to the maintainers listed in `MAINTAINERS.md`.
