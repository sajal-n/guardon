# Maintainers

Current maintainers and points of contact for the Guardon project. This file is intentionally small — the project is open to additional maintainers by nomination.

- Sajal Nigam (@sajal-n) — primary maintainer — sajalnigam@gmail.com

How to become a maintainer:

1. Contribute several high-quality PRs and participate in reviews.
2. Be nominated by an existing maintainer and approved by consensus among maintainers.

If you'd like to join the maintainer team, open an issue titled "Maintainer nomination" and describe your contributions and interests.
